    <h1>Group 1 - Test</h1>
    <small>by Martin Skurtveit, Joakim Fremstad, Erlend Marius Ommundsen, Lærke Svendsen
        <br>Written 08.11.2018</small>
    <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
    <p>Client name: HTMLearning</p>
    <p>Website Name: HTMLearning</p>
    <p>Contact person: Skybert Bertulfsen</p>


    <h2>Testing of the website</h2>
    <p>
    The test subject will be asked to perform the following list of tasks on
    our website.  We will take notes on how the user manages to do the tasks.
    After the test has concluded, the test subject may give some comments about
    his/her user experience.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>View the front page and find the main content</li>
      <li>Create a user</li>
      <li>Login with this user</li>
      <li>Find a course that looks interesting</li>
      <li>Find out where and when the course takes place</li>
      <li>Find the contact information of the company</li>
      <li>Look up who works for the company</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    As we ourselves are students, the student part of our audience is much easier to reach, than the working part. Each of us were required to interview at least one person.
    <!-- Add how many were students / working -->
    <h2>Testing platforms</h2>
    Our testers used:
    <ul>
        <li>PC with Chrome v.69.0.3497.100</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Feedback summary</h2>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>Some conventions, like the contact information in the footer, are good to have.</p>
    <p>User became confused about the "Register for course" button, as it was believed that registering referred to signing in, and the user therefore had to sign in before registering for the course.</p>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>Easy to get around. On a lot of the tasks the users eyes automatically moved to the navbar.</p>
    <p>When looking for the next course date, the user immediately went to the specific course page, and did not notice the text on the link.</p>
    <h3>Responsive design</h3>
    <p>Still a bit lacking, as some elements overlap on smaller screens. User noted that the contact information in the footer was only partly visible on a 12'' PC screen. </p>
