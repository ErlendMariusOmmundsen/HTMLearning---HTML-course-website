    <h1>Group 1 - Test</h1>
    <small>by Martin Skurtveit, Joakim Fremstad, Erlend Marius Ommundsen, Lærke Svendsen
        <br>Written 08.11.2018</small>
    <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
    <p>Client name: HTMLearning</p>
    <p>Website Name: HTMLearning</p>
    <p>Contact person: Skybert Bertulfsen</p>


    <h2>Testing of the website</h2>
    <p>
    The test subject will be asked to perform the following list of tasks on
    our website.  We will take notes on how the user manages to do the tasks.
    After the test has concluded, the test subject may give some comments about
    his/her user experience.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>View the front page and find the main content</li>
      <li>Create a user</li>
      <li>Login with this user</li>
      <li>Find a course that looks interesting</li>
      <li>Find out where and when the course takes place</li>
      <li>Find the contact information of the company</li>
      <li>Look up who works for the company</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    <p>As we ourselves are students, the student part of our audience is much easier to reach, than the working part. Each of us were required to interview at least one person.</p>
    <h2>Testing platforms</h2>
    <p>Our testers used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PC with Chrome v.69.0.3497.100</li>
        <li>Linux with Firefox v.63.0.1 with 1920x1080 resolution</li>
        <li>Windows PC with Chrome Version 70.0.3538.77</li>
		<li>Lenovo with Firefox v. 63.0.1</li>
		<li>Android with Google Chrome</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Feedback summary</h2>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>Some conventions, like the contact information in the footer, are good to have.</p>
    <p>User became confused about the "Register for course" button, as it was believed that registering referred to signing in, and the user therefore had to sign in before registering for the course.</p>
    <p>One user thought that the alerts when registering for course were 
       annoying. User rather wanted a banner to popup under the navbar instead.</p>
    <p>Other users mentioned that some pages had almost too much information on them.
       They said that the course pages were a bit cluttered.</p>
    <p>
      Another user pointed out that the site looks good and does its task well.
      He pointed out that he thinks the course page looks a bit barren on a wide
      screen, and suggested that we limit the width. He also had some trouble
      understanding the process of signing up, because of the validating input.
    </p>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>Easy to get around. On a lot of the tasks the users eyes automatically moved to the navbar.</p>
    <p>When looking for the next course date, the user immediately went to the specific course page, and did not notice the text on the link.</p>
    <h3>Responsive design</h3>
    <p>Still a bit lacking, as some elements overlap on smaller screens. User noted that the contact information in the footer was only partly visible, but this was fixed after the test.
	A user thought the mobile version was working alright, and had no problems using it even though we have prioritized PC browsing.</p>
    <h2>Our response to the feedback</h2>
    <p>
      Our test subjects have given us some useful thoughts and suggestions on
      how to improve the site. Most of the feedback is indeed actionable, for
      instance we could limit the width on the course page, and fix some of the
      overlap. We could also add more detailed messages when validating input in
      the login and signup forms.
    </p>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      We feel that the project experience as a whole is positive. We got a feel of the limits and possibilities for the different languages, and we learned to
      work as a team where everyone had different strengths. We also used this
      project to learn how to use Git at the same time, which has been
      rewarding. However it takes a lot of time and work for only a part of the
      total grade. Although this is a basic course, to learn the basic functions
      of HTML, CSS, and JS. We feel it is very limiting, because there are very
      many useful and important parts that are neglected, such as flexboxes.
