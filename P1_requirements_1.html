    <h1>Group 1 - requirements draft</h1>

    <h2>Choice of client</h2>
    <p>For this project, we have chosen an imaginary client who wishes to create a website for the HTML-courses, and other courses, they offer here in Trondheim. The company HTMLearning, aims to promote and sell their courses through a website. They have requested a website with user registration and a plain design to make it easier for inexperienced users to navigate the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
    <p>The site shall inform users about upcoming courses, prices, and other details about the courses offered, in addition to making it possible to register to a course. In this way the company wishes to reach more of their user base, and make it easier to use their services. To goal is to increase the number of participants in the courses.<br />
        As a second goal the company wishes to become more known, and improve their reputation. This is achieved by making the site easy to navigate, always available across devices.
    </p>


    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The websites intended audience is people that want to learn HTML and additional web technologies, but mainly students and people who need it for work. They can be completely new to coding, or they can already have some experience. “HTMLearning” should cater to every level of coding skill. Since the user has different starting points when it comes to knowledge, they need detailed information about the courses that the site provides. One challenge with this audience is the wide variety of devices they use. This could prove challenging when trying to implement a consistent design.
    </p>

    <h2>Content of site</h2>
    <p>The company wants to have a front page, with a short introduction to the website and HTML itself. They also want a menu to navigate to the rest of the site’s content, accessible from all parts of the website. From the menu bar, a user should be able to reach the most essentials part of the site: Front page, Courses overview, About the company, FAQ and Log in. The courses overview should be well-organized, to let the user easily separate the different types of courses. There should also be a part of the website that shows how to come in touch with the company.
