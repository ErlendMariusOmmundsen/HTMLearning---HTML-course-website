    <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
    <p>Client name: HTMLearning</p>
    <p>Website Name: HTMLearning</p>
    <p>Contact person: Skybert Bertulfsen</p>


    <h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
    <p>The company HTMLearning, aims to promote and sell their courses through a website. The site shall inform users about upcoming courses and the company in general. In this way the company wishes to reach more of their user base, and make it easier to use their services. The goal is to increase the number of participants in the courses. As a second goal the company wishes to become more known, and improve their reputation. The websites intended audience is people that want to learn HTML and additional web technologies, but mainly students and people who need it for work. “HTMLearning” should cater to every level of coding skill. One challenge with this audience is the wide variety of devices they use. This could prove challenging when trying to implement a consistent design.
    </p>

    <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
    <p>In order to give the user a short overview of the main pages of the site, the navbar at the top links to the main choices and reasons for visiting the site. This way the user can easily move from one part of the site to another without having to move back to the front page.
    </p>
    <p>When the user have made their goal of visiting the site clear by choosing one of the main pages, they can then be shown more detailed information about the choice they have made. The pages with details about lecturers and courses are more specific pages, and therefore well suited to this purpose. The user can still change their mind about their purpose for visiting, as the navbar will be available from all pages.
    </p>
    <p>The registration of a user is nested under the login page because the purpose of logging in is still the goal, and registration is something presumably only done once by each user.
    </p>
    <p>In the list below each root point can be accessed from the menu bar. As the menu bar is available on all pages, these pages will be accessible from all other pages. The children of these pages are accessible only from these pages. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Front page</li>
        <li>Courses overview
            <ul>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Quiz if the knowledge level of the course requires it</li>

    <p>The pages Lecturer and Detailed course description are not merely a single page, but many individual pages for each of the lecturers and courses offered from HTMLearning. The skeleton for these pages will be the same though, and only the content will be different.</p>

    <h2>Design and layout</h2>
    <p>The goal of the site will be to get as many course takers as possible. Our main focus when it comes to the design of the web page is therefore minimalism, ability to navigate with ease and user friendliness. We will try to to achieve this by having clear and contrasted colors, not having overcrowded pages and by hopefully having an intuitive layout. The navigation bar will always be visible, even when scrolling. By doing this, the user will always be able to go where it wants to go. These main pages will have sub pages where the user can obtain additional information. The target group of the site is people who want to learn HTML or need to learn it for work related reasons. Both young people and adults should be greeted with enough information to apply for a course. Our client requested that the logo also should be visible, along with the navigation bar, at all times. Visitors will hopefully, because of the logo, remember the name and brand. </p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mockup and description of homepage, navigation bar and footer</li>
        <p>The frontpage is what the user will see first when they navigate our website, therefore it’s important to have an attractive,
            but also intuitive frontpage. We decided that this color will attract the users attention along with the huge banner. It is also
            important that the site is intuitive, the user can scroll down to reach the homepage, but we also added buttons to give the viewer
            more control. We haven’t fully decided what the objects on the homepage should link to, right now the idea is for it to be an
            introduction to our website with links to other parts of the website. Another idea is to have a news feed with links to own articles,
            the articles can include recent news, tips for coding or links to helpful pages like https://www.w3schools.com/html/. The links
            are put inside frames consisting of text and a picture, whereas the frame will float left or right. The size
            of the picture should be 150x150.
        </p>

        <p>
            A navigation bar should link to the most essential parts of our website. We decided to make it horizontal in the top of the screen,
            it’s supposed to be sticky if the user scrolls down. This should give the user control of what happens and lets them navigate easily
            across the website. The navigation bar should cover the full width of the screen, on all platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the footer we put info about HTMLearning, including contact information and localization. This will always be at the bottom of
            every page, covering the full width. The contact information will be to the left and the localization on the right, with a map.
        </p>

                The image contains the frontpage, navigation menu and the footer, the contents of the page are yet to be decided.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <li>Mockup and description of courses overview</li>
        <p> All the different course types available are shown in an overview, with each type within a colored box and space between boxes to
            easily separate the types. Each box is clickable and redirects to a page for the specific course type with more detailed info and
            the option to register for the course. The box is the same color as the buttons of the menu and will change background color on
            mouseover, to make it clearer that it is clickable.
            Information about price and the date of the next course is shown to make it easier for the user to decide whether they are interested
            in learning more about the course or not.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <li>Mockup and description of course-page</li>
        <p> These pages offers all information relevant to the specific course type. The information at the top is deemed most relevant, with
            less relevant information going down the page. A sidebar to the right with key information about price, location and the lecturer is
            shown for easy access to this information, and because each link further (price with the register button, location to a map, and
            lecturer to the lecturer page). If a quiz is available for the course this will also be shown in this bar.
            Reviews are hidden by default in order to not bombard the user with too much information, but can be shown by clicking the
            “Show reviews” button.

        <li>Mockup and description of FAQ </li>
        <p> The FAQ-page contains a list of frequently asked questions. Answers are hidden until a user clicks on them. They will the slide
            down beneath the question in text that is smaller the the questions. The question should change to a slightly lighter color when it
            is hovered over, this will indicate that it is clickable.
            With this page, the client wants to provide helpful information about the page and themselves. It will provide info about such as how
            to sign up for a course, where the client is located, where the physical courses are located etc.
            The questions will be centered, and the text will float to the left. The questions will have font-size 22px and the answers will have
            font-size 18px.

        <li>Mockup and description of About us </li>
        <p>The about us page contains information about the client, such as the aim and services it provides. Additionally it contains an
            overview of their lecturers. This page will give customers and potential customers information that might be of their interest.
            On top of the page, there will be a few sentences about the client. Below the text, there will be some pictures on the left which will
            be of employees, coursetakers and an example of code. On the right, there will be a box with a text about what the clients general
            mission is. On the bottom of the page, there will be boxes with text with a tiny bit of info about each lecturer. The boxes will have
            circular pictures of the lecturer that is described inside the box.
            The biggest image will be 250 x 350, the smaller ones will be 125 x 165. The circular images will be 120 x 120.

        <li>Mockup and description of lecturers-page</li>

        <p> The lecturers page will provide the users with information about each and every lecturer they might want to know more about. With this page the client wishes that the coursetakers should be able to make taking courses on “HTMLearning” a more personal experience. Knowing a bit about the ones lecturing you, might help with that.
            The page will have a picture on the right side of the lecturer in question. On the left side, there will be a short text with information concerning the lecturer. Below the text and pictures, there will be buttons. The buttons will cycle through the list of the lecturers the client has at their disposal.
            The picture will be 300 x 400 and the buttons will be 120 x 40.
        </p>

        <li>Mockup and description of login and sign up</li>
        <p>The login and registration is done in one page, separated by a tab just above the forms. The entirety of the page will be centered in a box. In this box the user will be able to create an account on the site, or login with as an existing user. There will be input fields for first name, last name, e-mail address, password and the confirmation of the password in the sign up tab. The login tab will only have input fields for the existing users’ e-mail address and password. The form will also do some client-side validation on the email and on the length of the username and password.
            The point of this page is obviously to let users have accounts with which they are able to log in with.
            The box will be 375 x 500, the sign up-/login button will be 150 x 50 and the tabs will be 187.5 x 100.

        <li>Mockup and description of the quizzes</li>
        <p>The quiz is a multiple choice quiz (radiobuttons) with technical questions about the course material. Every question has four alternatives where only one of them is correct. The answers are validated by javascript (see below). The progress bar at the bottom shows the user which questions have been answered right or wrong, and how many questions are left of the quiz. This gives the user a feeling of progress, and an indication of how well their doing.
            Clicking the “Previous question” button takes the user to the previous question, and allows the user another chance at answering right. Since this is only a causal quiz, and not a requirement of the user to register for the course, the option to redo a question is open.
            The user can at any time quit the quiz by clicking back to the detailed course page they came from with the “Back to course page” button.
            At the end of the quiz the user will be presented with their score, and a recommendation of whether they would benefit from taking the course. The quiz can of course also be used after taking a course to remember what was being taught.
        </p>

    </ol>

    <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
    <p> We've come up with some ideas to reach the minimum requirements goal and decided to make these js-functions:</p>
    <h3>FAQ (help.js)</h3>
    <p>On the FAQ page we want the questions to be visible, but not the answers. However when the user clicks on a question, the answer should roll out under the question. When the user clicks the question again, the answer should roll back up and disappear.</p>

    <h3>Registration for a course and as a user (registration.js and user.js)</h3>
    <p>When a user registers for a course, a notification should appear confirming the registration.
        The same should happen when a user registers a profile on the webpage.
    </p>

    <h3>Pre-tests for courses (quiz.js)</h3>
    <p>A quiz to help users understand which course is the most appropriate given their previous knowledge. It will keep a total score during the quiz and at the end it will give the user an evaluation indicating if the course would be too easy, hard or just perfect.</p>

    <h3>Dynamically load lecturer info (lecturer.js)</h3>
    <p>We want to load the information about lecturers and courses from a JSON-file, in order to increase the maintainability of the webpage.</p>

    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>A good website requires a good structure, below is an overview of the files hierarchy, followed by a plan for each file with deadlines. Changes might occur and will be documented.
    </p>

    <p>Note that the lecturers page is one document loaded dynamically, while the courses pages each have their own file. Even though both these pages are pages with the same layout only different information, we felt that the courses pages would have too much different information and links for it to be conveniently stored in a JSON-file. This may also allow lecturers and administrators to easily make individual changes to their course page. </p>

    <h3>File hierarchy</h3>

        <li>img/
            <ul>
